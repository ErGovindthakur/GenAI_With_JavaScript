# 🚀 Prompt Engineering - Beginner Friendly Notes

## 📌 Overview
Prompt engineering is the art of **designing effective prompts** to guide AI models (like ChatGPT) for better outputs.

---

## 🧑‍💻 What is Prompt Engineering?
- Writing **clear and structured instructions** to get the desired answer from AI.
- Think of it like **asking the right question** in the right way.

---

## 📝 What is a Prompt?
A **prompt** is the text or instruction you give to an AI model.

👉 Example:
- **Bad Prompt:** "Explain JS."
- **Good Prompt:** "Explain JavaScript basics in 5 bullet points with examples."

## 🔑 Types of Prompt Engineering

### 1️⃣ Zero-Shot Prompting
- No examples are given. You just ask the question.
- **Example:**
  - Prompt: *"Translate 'Good Morning' into Spanish."*
  - Output: "Buenos Días"

### 2️⃣ Few-Shot Prompting
- Provide **a few examples** so the model understands the pattern.
- **Example:**
  - Prompt:
    ```
    English: Hello → Spanish: Hola
    English: Thank You → Spanish: Gracias
    English: Good Night → Spanish: ?
    ```
  - Output: "Buenas Noches"

### 3️⃣ Chain-of-Thought Prompting
- Ask the model to **show reasoning step-by-step**.
- **Example:**
  - Prompt: *"If I have 2 apples and buy 3 more, how many in total? Explain step by step."*
  - Output: "You start with 2 apples. You add 3 more. 2 + 3 = 5. So, total = 5 apples."

## ✅ Best Practices for Prompt Engineering

1. **Start Simple & Iterate**
   - Begin with a basic prompt and improve step by step.
   - Example: First ask *"Summarize this article"*, then refine to *"Summarize in 3 bullet points for beginners"*.

2. **Clearly State Instructions**
   - Be direct about what you want.
   - Example: *"Write a 2-line summary in simple English."*

3. **Be Specific & Detailed**
   - Avoid vague words like "explain"; instead, define the format.
   - Example: *"Explain JavaScript closures with a code example and a real-life analogy."*

4. **Provide Example of Output Format**
   - Show the structure you want.
   - Example: *"List in this format → 1. Point 2. Point 3. Point"*

5. **Avoid Negative Instructions**
   - ❌ "Don’t use difficult words"
   - ✅ "Use simple words a beginner can understand"

6. **Move from Simple to Complex**
   - Start with easy tasks, then build complex ones.

7. **Reduce Fluff**
   - Keep prompts clear and short.
   - ❌ "Can you please, if possible, explain in a kind way..."
   - ✅ "Explain in simple terms with an example."

8. **Leverage Leading Words**
   - Start prompts with: *"Explain like I’m 10", "Summarize in 3 points", "Step-by-step"* etc.
